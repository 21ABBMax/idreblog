Today 3th of July, is a sunny and warm summer day here in Idre. The mosquitos are everywhere as I am digging up dirt from the ground, and hopefully catch some worms to use as bait later today when I will be fishing in Brunne.
Brunne is a small but very long stream where you can catch char and trout. When I had dug for 15 mintues, I had gathered a jar full of 25-30 big and delicious worms. I took my fishing rods and headed off. Brunne is quite near my Cabin, by bike it only takes like 5 minutes to get to one of my secret fishing places.

When I finally arrived to my special place, I took out my two rods. If it is one thing that I've learned over the years of fishing, it is that you always need to be prepered in case something goes wrong, for example getting the hook stuck under a log and you have to cut the line. Anyway, for the first 20 minutes nothing really happened, except for when I stepped on slipperly log and fell. But then, suddenly when the sun began to disepear behind the trees, something took my bait. Yes! finally I though.

It was a small (compared to the ones you can get in lakes, but for a Brunne Fish, it was quite impressive) char. From there on I got a bite on every throw. When the clock hit 9 pm it was time to head back home. In total I think I got almost 20 fishes. Most of them were chars but some were trouts (Trouts are my favourite), so you could say it was a pretty good afternoon.
