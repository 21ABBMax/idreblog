22th of February, me and my family went on a trip to "Hemeråsen" on our recently bought snowmobile. Hemeråsen is, btw another skii location pretty close to Idre Fjäll. That day we woke up at 9 am and eat breakfast soon thereafter. Whenever we go on a trip like this, we always take with us some food and "fika" (which is a Swedish word for cookies and more...). On todays trip we took with us hot dogs, coffe, Coke, and some topping for the hot dogs. When we were dressed with warm clothes, we sat off.
The trip was kina bumpy, because the snowmobile trail was not in it's best shape. The whole trip took aproximate 15 minutes.
On top of "Hemeråsen" we found a little shed with a wood stove inside. There we grilled our hot dogs and took cover from the very intense wind.
The view from up there were amazing! We could see all the way to Norway which is maybe more then a 100 kilimeters away.
When we were done eating, we packed our things and headed home. It was now almost dark outside, and the sunset could be seen behind "Norska Bergen".
The trip was awsome! and we got some good pictures on the sunset and the view.
