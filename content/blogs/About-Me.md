Hello! My name is Max Wigstein. I am the author and creator of this blog and website.
I currently live in Sweden in a city called Västerås.
Ever since primary school my main intrests has always been with computers in various ways.
It started off with computer games such as Minecraft and other games on my Wii.
And then my intrests in computers has envoled ever since, and I am currently in high school studying technology, such as programming
and 3d modeling. This website that you are looking on right now is a part of a school project in our web development class.
The project is about developing a website were you can post blogs in various themes. My theme on this blog is about Idre, which is a small village/ski resort area, which also is the location of my cabin.
Idre has a lot of nature and advetures to offer and therefore I have decided to share with you, my experiences in Idre.
